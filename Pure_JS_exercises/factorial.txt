Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product o
f all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.

//SOLIUTION 2

function factorialize(num) {
  for (var product = 1; num > 0; num--) {
    product *= num;
  }
  return product;
}

factorialize(5);


function factorialize(num) {
  if (num === 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  return num * factorialize(num - 1);
}

factorialize(5);
