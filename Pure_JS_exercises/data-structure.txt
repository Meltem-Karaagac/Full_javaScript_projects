We've defined a function, checkInventory, which receives a scanned item as an argument. 
Return the current value of the scannedItem key in the foods object. 
You can assume that only valid keys will be provided as an argument to checkInventory.

let foods = {
  apples: 25,
  oranges: 32,
  plums: 28,
  bananas: 13,
  grapes: 35,
  strawberries: 27
};

function checkInventory(scannedItem) {
  // Only change code below this line

return foods[scannedItem]
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(checkInventory("apples"));

Use the delete keyword to remove the oranges, plums, and strawberries keys from the foods object.

let foods = {
  apples: 25,
  oranges: 32,
  plums: 28,
  bananas: 13,
  grapes: 35,
  strawberries: 27
};

// Only change code below this line
delete foods.oranges;
delete foods.plums;
delete foods.strawberries;
// Only change code above this line

console.log(foods);


We've created an object, users, with some users in it and a function isEveryoneHere,
 which we pass the users object to as an argument. Finish writing this function so that 
it returns true only if the users object contains all four names, 
Alan, Jeff, Sarah, and Ryan, as keys, and false otherwise.


let users = {
  Alan: {
    age: 27,
    online: true
  },
  Jeff: {
    age: 32,
    online: true
  },
  Sarah: {
    age: 48,
    online: true
  },
  Ryan: {
    age: 19,
    online: true
  }
};

function isEveryoneHere(obj) {
if (
    obj.hasOwnProperty("Alan") &&
    obj.hasOwnProperty("Jeff") &&
    obj.hasOwnProperty("Sarah") &&
    obj.hasOwnProperty("Ryan")
  ) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;

}

console.log(isEveryoneHere(users));



Finish writing the getArrayOfUsers function so that it returns an array containing all 
the properties in the object it receives as an argument.



let users = {
  Alan: {
    age: 27,
    online: false
  },
  Jeff: {
    age: 32,
    online: true
  },
  Sarah: {
    age: 48,
    online: false
  },
  Ryan: {
    age: 19,
    online: true
  }
};

function getArrayOfUsers(obj) {
  // Only change code below this line
    return Object.keys(obj)
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(getArrayOfUsers(users));






Take a look at the object we've provided in the code editor. 
The user object contains three keys. The data key contains five keys,
 one of which contains an array of friends. From this, you can see how flexible 
objects are as data structures. We've started writing a function addFriend.
 Finish writing it so that it takes a user object and adds the name of the friend
 argument to the array stored in user.data.friends and returns that array.

let user = {
  name: 'Kenneth',
  age: 28,
  data: {
    username: 'kennethCodesAllDay',
    joinDate: 'March 26, 2016',
    organization: 'freeCodeCamp',
    friends: [
      'Sam',
      'Kira',
      'Tomo'
    ],
    location: {
      city: 'San Francisco',
      state: 'CA',
      country: 'USA'
    }
  }
};

function addFriend(userObj, friend) {
  // Only change code below this line
userObj.data.friends.push(friend);
return userObj.data.friends
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(addFriend(user, 'Pete'));
