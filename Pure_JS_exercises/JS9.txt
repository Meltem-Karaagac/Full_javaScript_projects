Basic JavaScript: Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

Here's how we would add a "bark" property to ourDog:

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";

or

ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";

Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, "bow-wow".

Example:

var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};


 

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
Add a "bark" property to myDog and set it to a dog sound, such as "woof". You may use either dot or bracket notation.




// Setup
var myDog = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};

// Only change code below this line
myDog.bark = "woof;"  // dot notation
myDog["bark"] = "woof" //bracet notation
