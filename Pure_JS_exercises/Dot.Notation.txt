Basic JavaScript: Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:

var myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};
var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2





// Setup
var testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats"
};

// Only change code below this line

var hatValue = testObj.hat;      // Change this line
var shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // Change this line
var shoesValue = testObj.shoes
