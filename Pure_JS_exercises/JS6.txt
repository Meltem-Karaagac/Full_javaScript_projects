Basic JavaScript: Accessing Object Properties with Variables
Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

var dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",  Hunter: "Doberman",  Snoopie: "Beagle"
};
var myDog = "Hunter";
var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"
Another way you can use this concept is when the property's name is collected dynamically during the program execution, as follows:

var someObj = {
  propName: "John"
};
function propPrefix(str) {
  var s = "prop";
  return s + str;
}
var someProp = propPrefix("Name"); // someProp now holds the value 'propName'
console.log(someObj[someProp]); // "John"
Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name.

Use the playerNumber variable to look up player 16 in testObj using bracket notation. Then assign that name to the player variable.



// Setup
var testObj = {
  12: "Namath",
  16: "Montana",
  19: "Unitas"
};

// Only change code below this line

var playerNumber = testObj[16];       // Change this line
var player = testObj[playerNumber];   // Change this line
