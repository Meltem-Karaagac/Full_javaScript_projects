Babel + TypeScript
Have you heard of Babel or TypeScript? They are heavily used in the Javascript 
ecosystem and you should now have a good idea of what they are:

Babel is a Javascript compiler that takes your modern JS code and returns  browser compatible JS (older JS code).
Typescript is a superset of Javascript that compiles down to Javascript.

Both of these do exactly what compilers do: Take one language and convert into a different one!
